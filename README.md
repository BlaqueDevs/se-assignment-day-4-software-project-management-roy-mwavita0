## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile and Waterfall are two distinct methodologies used in software development, each with its own approach, advantages, and disadvantages.

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It involves breaking the project into small, manageable chunks called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks. Whereas waterfall is a linear and sequential approach that follows a fixed sequence of phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.

The advantages of Agile is allowing changes and adujustments throughou the project, customer involment to engage their feedback, regularly delivering small increments of the product ensures quicker releases and early detection of issues, and frequent testing and reviews during sprints help identify and fix problems early.

The disadvantages on the hand include: due its flexible nature, Agile can be less predictable in terms of timeline and budget. It also relies heavily on effective communication and collaboration among team memmbers, which can be challenging.

The advantages of watergall is that it provides a clear, structured plan with defines milestones and deadlines, making it easier to predict timelines and costs. The linear structure and well-defined phases make it easier to manage and track progress. Also, extensive documentation in each phase ensures a comprehensive understandng of the project.

The disvantages of the waterfall include: inflexibility since it is less adaptable to changes, making it difficult to accomodate evolving requirements. Also testing is performed late in the process, which may lead ot discovering issues only at the end of the project. There is also limited customer feedback which only happens in the initial and final phases and this may result in a product that does not fully meet their needs.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Projects Beneficial for Agile Methodology:
a. Software Development Projects with Evolving Requirements: Agile is ideal for projects where requirements may change frequently due to evolving customer needs or technological advancements.
